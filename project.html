<p>Karnataka’s cuisine takes influence from its neighbours like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. However, the flavours change from region to region. Mangalore and Uttara Canara are famous for their tangy seafood. South Karnataka is known for various types of Bath. North Karnataka food is much spicier in comparison to the other parts of Karnataka. Food grains such as ragi, rice, jower, urad dal, semolina are some staples. Palm jaggery is also an important ingredient in Karnataka’s cuisine. Traditionally, meals are served on a banana leaf.</p>

<p>South Indian food is revered and loved around the country and beyond it. The unique flavours, the tangy twist, the sweet infusions and the plethora of vegetables used in any recipe is a head turner for most vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. But, it is also considered criminal to group all south Indian food under one broad banner. Tamil Nadu Food is very different from the food of other regions like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.</p>

	<p>Andhra Pradesh is known for its spicy food all around the country. The inspiration behind such delicious variations of food lies in the opulent culture of the state, where exotic food is being prepared in the kitchen of the Nawabs since the year of its origin. The Andhra cuisine comprises of both mouth-watering vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes.

	<p>God's Own Country, Kerala seems to live up to the exquisite title that has been given to it as it takes you on a gastronomical journey of mind-boggling food items which are so tasty that they appear to be right out of 'God's Own Kitchen'! Surrounded by the sea, Kerala is home to numerous lip-smacking dishes prepared out of seafood, some of which include mussels, crab, tiger prawns, king prawns, tiny prawns, oysters, sardines, mackerel, tuna and gorgeous red lobsters. One just cannot stop salivating when walking the streets of Kerala. Unlike its neighbours, Kerala takes a lot of pride in its long list of non-vegetarian food that the state has to offer to its perpetually hungry tourists! I am not taking any sides here, but Kerala food includes everything? chicken, mutton, beef, fish, pork and the thrilling variety of seafood as already mentioned. So let's begin the herculean task of listing down some of its greatest Kerala food dishes.</p>

	<p>When it comes to food, the land of Marathas can never disappoint you. From the world-famous pav bhaji to the delicious poha, Maharashtra has a lot to offer to food lovers.

Maharashtrian cuisine can be broadly classified into two styles- Konkan and Varadi. Konkan being from the coastal region has influences from Goan, Saraswat, Gaud and Malvani regions. Varadi cuisine, on the other hand, belongs to the Vidarbha region. Some spices like Goda Masala, Kokum, Tamarind and Coconut are essential ingredients in the Maharashtrian kitchen. Maharashtrian cuisine is considered to be very diverse as the flavours and spice levels differ in different parts of the state.</p>
